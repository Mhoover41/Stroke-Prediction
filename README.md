## Project Description
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Data Link: [healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv](https://github.com/Mhoover41/Stroke-Prediction/files/11501796/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv)

## Data Dictionary
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient
